                    ✅ REVERTED TO ORIGINAL VANILLA JAVASCRIPT
================================================================================

I've reverted everything back to the original vanilla JavaScript version.

WHAT WAS RESTORED:
------------------
✅ index.html - Original HTML structure (no React)
✅ package.json - Original package.json for server.js
✅ script.js - Already was the original (untouched)
✅ styles.css - Already was the original (untouched)
✅ server.js - Already was the original (untouched)

WHAT WAS REMOVED:
-----------------
❌ vite.config.js - Removed (React/Vite config)
❌ React files in src/ folder - Still there but ignored (won't affect anything)

HOW TO RUN:
-----------
Option 1: Just open index.html in browser
- Double-click index.html
- It will work directly (no server needed for basic functionality)

Option 2: Use the server (for full functionality)
- Run: npm start
- Or: node server.js
- Open: http://localhost:3000

THE APP IS NOW BACK TO ORIGINAL VANILLA JAVASCRIPT!
No React, no Node.js build tools needed.
Just open index.html and it works!
